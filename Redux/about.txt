About :-

Redux is like a state management tool where we store some data and whenever we need
the required data then we can simply get them from the store.

CartSlice:- 
'CartSlice.js' is a file used in Redux to manage the state of a shopping cart.
It defines actions and reducers related to cart functionality, such as adding or removing items.
This helps keep the cart's state consistent and predictable throughout the application.
